    <h3>Cooking Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Everything Seasoning: Combine all ingredients in a small bowl and taste, adjust seasonings to your liking.
            Mix can be stored in an airtight container for up to 3 months.
        </li>
        <li>Caramelize the onions: Heat about 1 tablespoon of canola oil in a large skillet or dutch oven over
            medium-low heat. <br>Once hot, add the onions and stir to coat. Let cook, stirring every 5-10 minutes, until
            deeply caramelized, about 1 ½ - 2 hours. <br>If the onions start to burn at any point, lower the heat slightly
            and add a splash of water to deglaze any bits stuck to the pan. <br>Season with salt and set aside to cool
            completely.
        </li>
        <li>For the Dip: Place cream cheese in a medium bowl and whip with a hand mixer until light and fluffy. <br>Add in
            creme fraiche and buttermilk, whip again until fluffy. Add caramelized onions, everything seasoning, and a
            pinch of salt and whip again. <br>Taste and adjust seasoning as needed before transferring to a serving bowl and
            topping with more everything seasoning and chives. <br>Excellent served alongside vegetables or pita chips.
