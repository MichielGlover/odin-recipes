    <h3>Membrillo is a sweetened quince jelly, which, given that quince is related to the pear and apple, goes
        brilliantly with pork.</h3>

    <p>In the Upper Peninsula, thimbleberries are a hot commodity--they’re treasured by moose, bears, dear, and even
        monks. </p>
    <p>Transport yourself to the lush, green wonderland that is Michigan’s coastline with this quick yet decadent dish.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>¼ cup granulated sugar, divided</li>
        <li>About ¼ cup heavy cream, divided</li>
        <li>2 small red apples, cores removed and chopped into large pieces</li>
        <li>Unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon apple cognac</li>
        <li>3 thick slices white sandwich bread</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Thimbleberry jam</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons crème fraîche</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Cooking Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by placing two large nonstick skillets over medium-high heat.
        </li>
        <li>Crack the eggs into a bowl and whisk, then continue whisking while adding about 1 ½ tablespoons sugar,
            followed by heavy cream. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>Add remaining sugar to one skillet and let sit for a moment so it begins to caramelize. Add the apples to
            the pan along with about a tablespoon of butter, tossing to coat.
        </li>
        <li>Drizzle the apple cognac over the apples, followed by another tablespoon or so of heavy cream.
        </li>
        <li>Bring the mixture to a low boil.
        </li>
        <li>Quickly dip each slice of bread into the egg mixture to coat, but don’t let it soak.
        </li>
        <li>Add a tablespoon of olive oil to the other skillet along with about a tablespoon of butter. <br>Once melted, add
            the coated slices to the hot pan and let brown. Add a few teaspoons of butter around the edges of the pan.
            <br>Carefully flip each bread slice (only flip once!) to lightly brown the other side, then remove from heat.
        </li>
        <li>Once the apples have absorbed the cream and are jammy and almost candied, remove from heat.
        </li>
        <li>To serve, spread a couple of tablespoons of thimbleberry jam onto one slice of bread on a plate, then top
            with a few tablespoons of the caramel apples.
        </li>
        <li>Place another slice of bread on top of the apples and repeat. <br>Place the third slice of bread on top, then
            top with a dollop with crème fraîche, followed by a small bit of thimbleberry jam. Scatter any remaining
            apples around the plate and serve.
        </li>
    </ol>
